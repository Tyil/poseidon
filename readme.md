# Poseidon
An automatic music downloader for private trackers.

This project is meant to become a competitor to Headphones. Sadly, as this is a
hobby project and I only have so much spare time, don't consider it anything
worthwhile.

## Getting started
Clone this repository and start the application using `npm`:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tyil/poseidon poseidon
cd $_
npm install
npm start
```

This will compile the react application and start a webserver on `127.1:3000`.
